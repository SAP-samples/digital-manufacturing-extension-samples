## Prerequiste
### 1. Set Up a Destination in Your Subaccount
To call a public API in your coding you first need to setup a destination in your subaccount pointing to the Public API. 
Details you can find on SAP HELP https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-digital-manufacturing/operations-guide/prepare-for-api-integration
#### 2. Configure the SAP Cloud Application Router (xs-app.json)
In the xs-app.json file the configuration for your SAP Cloud Application Router, which helps route incoming requests within your app, is defined. 
Make sure it points to the destination you have defined.
#### 3. Adjust environment configuration settings settings in SAP BTP
Issue: Many modern browsers, including Google Chrome, have tightened restrictions on third-party cookies to improve privacy and security.
This can impact authentication flows or application behavior that relies on cookies for session management
Solution: Navigate to the SAP BTP Space where your application is deployed. Locate your environment configuration settings.
Add or modify the variable: COOKIE_BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY=true
This instructs SAP BTP to maintain compatibility with older cookie behavior, helping resolve login and session issues.
