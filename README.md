# SAP Digital Manufacturing Extension Samples
SAP Digital Manufacturing provides an out-of-the-box Manufacturing Execution System (MES) to run production on the shop floor. However, based on the experience gained from customer and partner projects, we also know that a successful MES must have the capability to be extended. With the new releases of Digital Manufacturing, the options for extensibility have made a significant step forward. Using the sample extensions provided will allow you to learn and understand how to build your own extensions to use with SAP Digital Manufacturing.

## Description
The [POD Plugins Developer Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-digital-manufacturing/pod-plugin-developer-s-guide/introduction) provides more details on developing custom plugins. Some of the templates can be referred as following code snippets.

- POD Plugin Extension
- Core Plugin Extension
